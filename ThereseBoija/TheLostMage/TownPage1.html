  	<h2>On our way to town</h2>
  	<p>On our way to the town we meet some evil dude standing in the middle of
      the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Do you think you can find your beloved mage that easily!
  <br>
  <br>
  The evil guy has such an evil grin on his face as he forms an energybolt
  with his hands. I pull Alice behind me as I face the man and say with a hint
  of anger in my tone.
  <br>
  <br>
  - You will not get away with this!
  <br>

  	<h2>What should I do?</h2>

  	<li><a href="TownPage2.html">Attack the guy with my own magic</a></li>
