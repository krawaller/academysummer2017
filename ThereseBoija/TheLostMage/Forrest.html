  	<h2>In the forrest</h2>
  	<p>We walk around in the forrest trying to find Biogrid. We get to the old
      ruines when we hear a big grumble.
  <br>
  <br>
  - What is this?
  <br>
  <br>
  I ask Alice but she shakes her head as if to say she doesn't know. In front of
  us are four mages fighting against each other and it looks heated. I can't see
  Biogrid anywhere so I decide to back away slowly whispering to Alice.
  <br>
  <br>
  - We should look for our lost mage elsewhere.
