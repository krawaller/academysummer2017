  	<h2>On our way home</h2>
  	<p>Just when we had lost all hope we see Biogrid fighting agains lots
    of little evil gnomes. We rush in to help him. Alice says:
  <br>
  <br>
  - Take that you meanies. Feel my scratch, meow!
  <br>
  <br>
  I knock two gnomes out with the tilt of my sword as I make my way towards
  Biogrid and say victoriously:
  <br>
  <br>
  - We finally found you!
  <br>
  <br>
  We kill off the rest of the gnomes quickly and decide to celebrate our victory
  by going to Jensen's in Kistagallerian.
