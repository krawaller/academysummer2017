  	<h2>At home</h2>
  	<p>I was sitting in my favorite chair reading a very interesting book.
  	The pieceful quiet was suddenly broken by someone frantically knocking
  on my door.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Hold on, hold on I'm coming!
  <br>
  <br>
  I open the door as my friend, Alice, wet from the rain outside and shivering
  from the cold. I can barely hear what she was saying because of her teeth
  clappering toghether as she talked.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Tessan, this is terrible! Our bestest mage Biogrid has dissapeared.
  You have to help me find him!
  <br>
  <br>
</p>

  	<h2>What should I do?</h2>
  	<ul>
  	<li><a href="Forrest.html">Follow Alice to look for Biogrid in the forrest</a></li>
    <br>
