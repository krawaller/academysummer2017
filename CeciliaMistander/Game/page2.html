        <h2>A hungry troll..</h2> <br />
      Since this cute troll is a hungry one,<br />
      and also fears nothing, he contiunes eating.<br />
      <br />
      It seems like the bear is a kind one,<br />
      so he sits down next to the troll and kindly asks: <br />
      "May I have a taste of that delicious hobbit?" <br />
      <br />

      So the troll and the bear sits down together and share a meal!<br />
